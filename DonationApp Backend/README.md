# Donation App Backend
Backend for requesting an authorization code to be used with [my Donation Kiosk App](https://github.com/mzc13/DonationApp).

## Requesting a code
The user is first brought to this page to initialize the authorization process.

Finally, the user is granted an authorization code and there is a button that will automatically copy the code for them.
